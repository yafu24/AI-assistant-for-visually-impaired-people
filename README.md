# AI-Assistant-For-Visually-Impaired-People
This AI Assistant for Visually Impaired People is an advanced assistive technology designed to help individuals with visual impairments navigate their environment, access information, and perform daily tasks more independently. The system leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech Recognition to provide real-time assistance through voice commands, object recognition, and environmental descriptions.

## Overview
This project utilizes various AI technologies to provide visually impaired individuals with enhanced accessibility features. <br/>
The system includes voice recognition, speech-to-text conversion, and text-to-speech synthesis to enable users to interact with their environment more effectively.

## Features
- **Voice Assistant**: The system includes a voice assistant that responds to user commands and provides information on the surrounding environment.
- **Object Recognition**: The AI model can recognize objects and describe them to the user.
- **Summarizer**: The system describes what it sees and summarizes it to the user. 
- **Speech-to-Text**: The system converts spoken words into text, allowing users to communicate more easily.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The system converts written text into spoken words, enabling users to access written information.

## Use Cases
- **Daily Activities**: Identifying household objects, locating furniture, or organizing personal items.
- **Reading Assistance**: Scanning text on signs, labels, or books.
- **Shopping Assistance**: Identifying products, reading price tags, and recognizing currency.
- **Navigation Support**: Providing directions for outdoor or indoor navigation.
- **Social Interaction**: Recognizing faces and identifying voices.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multilingual Support**: Expanding language recognition and translation features.
- **Edge AI Processing**: Running AI models directly on devices for faster and offline processing.
- **Integration with Smart Home Devices**: Controlling IoT-enabled devices like lights, thermostats, and security systems.
- **Wearable Devices**: Smart glasses or audio-enabled wearables for hands-free interaction.
